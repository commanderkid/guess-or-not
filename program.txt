Оставлю здесь. Одно из упражнений на edx. MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

<b>Описание:</b>

In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

Note: your program should use input to obtain the user's input! Be sure to handle the case when the user's input is not one of h, l, or c.

# Paste your code into this box
print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
a, b, guess = 0, 100, ""
while guess != "c":
    perem = (a + b) // 2
    guess_o = print("Is your secret number " + str(perem) + "?")
    guess = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
    if guess == "c":
        print("Game over, your guess is " + str(perem) + "!")
    elif guess == "l":
        a = perem
    elif guess == "h":
        b = perem
    else:
        print("Sorry, I didn't understand your input")
